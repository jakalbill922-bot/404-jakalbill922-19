    "positive": "Show the object clearly in a three-quarters view with the full object visible and centered. Use a neutral, solid background with strong contrast to the object. Remove all background elements, text, logos, and watermarks. Preserve the original object category, geometry, proportions, and structure exactly as shown. Keep original colors and materials without enhancement. Ensure sharp edges, clear contours, accurate perspective, and realistic surface detail. Aim for a neutral, scan-like reference suitable for precise 3D reconstruction.",
